# DOA-Estimation
In signal processing, direction of arrival denotes the direction from which usually a propagating wave arrives at a point, where usually a set of sensors are located. These set of sensors forms what is called a sensor array. This project aims to estimate DOA of an audio signal.

Testing is performed emitting an audio signal (clap in the example) from various direction:
